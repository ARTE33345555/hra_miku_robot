🤖 ROBOT_OS v5.0 — Human Robot Artem (HRA)Human Robot Artem (HRA) is an advanced operating system for a humanoid robot powered by NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This project integrates active balancing, computer vision, AI-driven cognition, and a multilingual synthesis engine into a unified robotic framework.🌟 Key Features🧠 Neural Brain: Powered by local LLM (Ollama Phi-3) for context-aware, intelligent dialogue.⚖️ Active Stability: Real-time PID control loop using MPU6050 data to manage 4 servos (Hips & Knees).👁️ Realsense Vision: High-speed depth and color processing via Intel RealSense D435.🗣️ Polyglot Miku: Automatic language detection (RU/EN/JA) with voice synthesis via Hatsune Miku TTS API.👂 Coqui STT Hearing: Local speech-to-text processing for low-latency voice command execution.🔒 Secure Control: Encrypted TCP server using Fernet (AES-128) for remote operation.🛡️ Reflex System: Immediate "Pain" reflex processing via GPIO touch sensors.🏗 System ArchitectureThe OS utilizes a multi-threaded architecture to ensure critical tasks like balancing are never interrupted by heavy AI computations:Physics Thread (50Hz): Constant IMU polling and servo correction.TCP Thread: Listens for incoming encrypted remote commands.Main Loop: Manages the vision pipeline, voice recognition, and Ollama reasoning.🔌 Hardware MapComponentInterfaceDescriptionMPU6050I2C (SDA1/SCL1)Vestibular system (Gyro/Accel)L/R HIPPin 24 / 32Hip joint servosL/R KNEEPin 26 / 33Knee joint servosTouch SensorPin 7Pain/Impact reflexCameraUSB 3.0Intel RealSense D435🚀 Quick Start1.
