ROBOT_OS v5.2.1 — Human Robot Artem (HRA)

Human Robot Artem (HRA) is an advanced operating system for a humanoid robot powered by NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
It unifies real-time balance control, computer vision, local AI cognition, and multilingual voice interaction into a single robotic framework.

🌟 Key Features
🧠 Neural Brain

Local LLM powered by Ollama (Phi-3)

Context-aware intelligent dialogue

Fully offline AI reasoning

⚖️ Active Stability

Real-time PID control loop

IMU-based balancing using MPU6050

Control of 4 servos (hips & knees)

👁️ RealSense Vision

Intel RealSense D435

High-speed RGB + depth processing

Vision pipeline optimized for Jetson

🗣️ Polyglot Miku Voice

Automatic language detection (RU / EN / JA)

Voice synthesis via Hatsune Miku TTS API

Dynamic language switching

👂 Coqui STT Hearing

Local speech-to-text processing

Low-latency voice command recognition

🔒 Secure Control

Encrypted TCP control server

Fernet (AES-128) encryption

Secure remote operation

🛡️ Reflex System

GPIO-based touch sensors

Immediate “pain” / impact reflex

Highest execution priority

🏗 System Architecture

ROBOT_OS uses a multi-threaded architecture to ensure critical processes (like balance) are never blocked by heavy AI workloads.
